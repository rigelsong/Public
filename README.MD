This collection of scripts demonstrates clear server side proficiency in Javascript/Node/ES6/npm libraries.

Included are:

A Node express HTTPS web server that can connect with OAuth 2 and includes the standard web security safety features
A web site data scraper that can be easily customized with JSON/regular expressions.
A dictionary-like PUT/GET wrapper around MongoDb that can be swapped out for SQL Server or any other database.
